During analysing the code-rain I realised that the guys in the movie were also staring it for the same reason:
to figure it out HOW THE F*CK IT WORX!
Meanwhile they practiced this tongue twister, saying it 150 wpm: "Matrix screensaver!"

A glitch catch: The 3 main monitors on the deck of Nebuchadnezzar show the exact same code rain.
Sitting there, Tank could've said 'DÃ©jÃ  vu!' 60 times an hour...

The middle monitor size in terms of character locations: 60x30. Since they show the same, I suppose the other two also have these dimensions.

This is according to the animations shown on CRT monitors in Matrix I.

Let's expand the observations to gain a more general comprehension which can explain some strange happenings as well!

A proper and dedicated terminology is indispensable:

Igniter drop
Extinguisher drop
Twin drops
Trail
Rain space
Screen space
Character location
Blind characters
Dynamic characters
Static characters
Standalone characters
Changing static characters
X-glitch
Drop fluctuation
Drop birth
Drop death
Excitement levels / States

> There's an "igniter drop", and an "extinguisher drop".
> Both can born and die somewhere in the rain space.
> "Rain space" is far bigger than the "screen space". We can only observe a small portion of the rain space through the screen. Thus it makes sense to use multiple monitors.
> The animation is blocky. The characters aren't refreshed one by one. The whole screen is refreshed frame by frame.
> There are character locations what are blank / burnt out and never show the code. These can form longer columns. This is a mask in screen space and doesn't bother in rain space.
> There's only one layer. No multiple rain layers in the background.
> All drops have the same fall speed.
> Let fall speed be 1 character per frame.
> Changes in character location state happens with slight transition due to the inertia of the phosphor excitement.
> Drops can often fall in pairs. I call them twins. But they are not connected. One can die independently from the other.
> After the igniter drop the glow disappears in 4 characters. The trail's 4th character doesn't glow at all.
> The extinguisher drop in effect is virtually the 2nd character from the trail's end. The trail fades to black in 2 characters. Putting it another way: a character location fades to black in 3 frames.
> Any character space can have two behaviours: changing and non-changing.
> Let 66% of the character locations be non-changing.
> Standalone character locations rarely can be ignited at random places.
> Very rarely can happen that a non-changing character changes, even so it keeps the non-changing state.
> Let's suppose: The random ignition of character locations changes also the static character (except the case when the randomly generated ignited character is the same as the preceding one) without a glow-up.
> Let's suppose: There is random extinguishion as well.

> The change property is basically fixed per character location. Falling drops cannot change it.
> Let's suppose: the occasional drops can cause character change. Let both type be able to do this.
> The igniter drop can jump to the neighbouring row occasionally and jump back after 1 character place immediately.
> Let's suppose: The extinguisher drop can jump to the neighbouring row occasionally as well.
> Because of this jumping the drops' movement has to be simulated 1-1 columns offscreen.
> Because of this behaviour unignited or unextinguished characters can be left behind.
> Blank space is also amongst the randomizable characters.

> I define 7 levels of phosphor excitement of the CRT screen for this animation:
 > 6: Glowing drop character
 > 5: Fading glow level 1.
 > 4: Fading glow level 2.
 > 3: Normal character appearance
 > 2: Fading character level 1.
 > 1: Fading character level 2.
 > 0: Blank (black)

> If an igniter drop touches a character location, ignition happens in state 0 (blank), 1 or 2 (fading because of extinguishion), and it turns into state 6. Any other states remain unaffected.
> A state 6 character location turns into state 5.
> A state 5 character location turns into state 4.
> A state 4 character location turns into state 3 and stays there until touched by extinguisher drops.
> If an extinguisher drop reaches a character location in state 3 to 6, it pushes that to state 2. The other states remain unaffected.
> A state 2 character location turns into state 1.
> A state 1 character location turns into state 0 and stays there until touched by igniter drops.

> For proper animation randomness has to be smartly handled.

Questions:
> Is there an observable standalone dynamic character?

If you find a bug in the animation - it's not my fault. It is a bug in the Matrix.

Stare it with love!
I've put lots of chicks inside there ðŸ™‚
